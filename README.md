Hi, I'm Cesar.

I'm a developer with experience in PHP Frameworks such as CodeIgniter and Laravel, currently I'm working as a Senior Engineer in a company based in El Salvador working with NodeJS as backend and ReactJS in frontend. Also, we are developing a new platform based on Angular, GraphQL and Tailwind CSS.
